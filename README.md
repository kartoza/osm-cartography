# OSM Cartography
Our collaborative work to provide an awesome QGIS cartography for OSM.

The style files for all the layers in the [`osm_mirror_qgis_project`](https://kartoza.github.io/osgs/workflows/create-osm-mirror-in-database.html) are provided as `.qml` and `.sld` files in the folders  `qml` and `sld` respectively. 

The OSM Mirror Cartographic Standards document is provided as an `.odt` file and markdown file in the `cartographic_standards` folder.
